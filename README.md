# calculator-cplusplus
This is a simple calculator application written in C++ that uses the switch-case structure to perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers.
What the Project Does
The project prompts the user to input two numbers and select an operation to perform. Based on the chosen operation (+, -, *, /), it calculates and displays the result. The core logic is implemented using a switch-case control structure for clarity and educational value.
Why the Project Is Useful
This project is useful for:
Beginners learning C++ programming, especially control structures like switch-case.
Anyone needing a quick and easy command-line calculator for basic arithmetic.
